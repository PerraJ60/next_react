This is an app developed in React, NextJS (Create-Next-App), using GraphQL, Apollo and Nexus. Typescript is also used, as well as Yarn.
Much in this is a mover-over from the Create-React-App based project in https://github.com/PerraJ60/react_route

GraphQL is used in 2 ways. We call some external GraphQL sites out there, but we also have or own backend with a server (not a real database , but technically). So we use getStaticProps in 2 ways as well.
The app is deployed to Vercel at:
https://next-react-kohl.vercel.app/
